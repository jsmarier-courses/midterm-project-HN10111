# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Foreword

I will examine a portion of the "2024 Service Requests" dataset from the city of Ottawa. My goal is to uncover a meaningful narrative / story that reflect the community's ingeactions with services. I look forward to sharing my process throughout this assignment.

## 1. Introduction

As mentioned in the foreword, I will be analyzing a dataset from the City of Ottawa that focuses on service requests made by residents in August 2024. These requests cover non-emergency issues such as road repairs, waste collection, and bylaw enforcment. The dataset provides detailed records of 311 service requests, including the type of service requested, the submission date, location, and status updates. The original dataset can be accessed on [Open Ottawa](https://open.ottawa.ca/documents/65fe42e2502d442b8a774fd3d954cac5/about), with a CSV version available on the [Github portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsmarier/course-datasets/refs/heads/main/ottawa-311-service-requests-august-2024.csv). 

This report consists of four main sections. First, getting data, I will explain how the dataset was imported into Google Sheets and provide initial observations about its structure and content. Second, in Understanding data, I will perform a VIMO analysis to evaluate the data's quality, followed by data cleaning and exploratory analysis to uncover patterns. Thrid, I will explore potential stories from the dataset. Finallly, in the conclusion, I will reflect on the challenges, insights, and key takeaways from ompleting the analysis. 

## 2. Getting Data

Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

*Figure 1: The "Import file" prompt on Google Sheets.*

**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.
