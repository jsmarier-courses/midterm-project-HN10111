# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Foreword

I will examine a portion of the "2024 Service Requests" dataset from the city of Ottawa. My goal is to uncover a meaningful narrative / story that reflect the community's ingeactions with services. I look forward to sharing my process throughout this assignment.

## 1. Introduction

As mentioned in the foreword, I will be analyzing a dataset from the City of Ottawa that focuses on service requests made by residents in August 2024. These requests cover non-emergency issues such as road repairs, waste collection, and bylaw enforcment. The dataset provides detailed records of 311 service requests, including the type of service requested, the submission date, location, and status updates. The original dataset can be accessed on [Open Ottawa](https://open.ottawa.ca/documents/65fe42e2502d442b8a774fd3d954cac5/about), with a CSV version available on the [Github portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsmarier/course-datasets/refs/heads/main/ottawa-311-service-requests-august-2024.csv). 

This report consists of four main sections. First, getting data, I will explain how the dataset was imported into Google Sheets and provide initial observations about its structure and content. Second, in Understanding data, I will perform a VIMO analysis to evaluate the data's quality, followed by data cleaning and exploratory analysis to uncover patterns. Thrid, I will explore potential stories from the dataset. Finallly, in the conclusion, I will reflect on the challenges, insights, and key takeaways from ompleting the analysis. 

## 2. Getting Data

To obtain the necessary data, I began by importing the dataset into Google Sheets. The involved downloading the CSV file from the Github portal. In Google Sheets, I selected "file", then "Import", followed by "Upload" to add my CSV file. After the import, I adjusted the settings to set the delimiter to "Comma", ensuring the columns would displayed correctly. 

You can see a results of this process in the screenshot below and in the attached [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZ9UBwwG1Ge7Uvxf2ftSpjDnVnBD0zheKhyqrZ12peE/edit?usp=sharing) link:
